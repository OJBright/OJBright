## About Me  
Hi, I’m **Jerome Bright Ogenrwot** – a biotechnology graduate turned _bioinformatician_ with extra certifications in **synthetic biology, genomics, and machine learning**.  
- **Graduate Intern** &nbsp;@ **African Centres of Excellence in Bioinformatics (ACE)** – developing pipelines that marry wet-lab insight with HPC-powered analytics.  
- **Development Lead** &nbsp;@ **Synbio Eco** – engineering _E. coli_ biosensors for environmental surveillance.  
- Focus areas: **clinical, pathogen & cancer genomics**.  
- Mission: build reproducible workflows that turn complex sequencing data into actionable biological insight.
